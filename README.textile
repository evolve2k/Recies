h1. Recies

'The best home recipies'

h2. Why?

Recies is the first Ruby on Rails project of my 9 year old son.
He's been practising ruby on and off for a little while now and has upgraded
from hackety hack to just straight shoes with a text editor (better IMHO).

He's also been teaching himself CSS and HTML5.

h2. What it does

A site full of delicious recipies.
A display of what a 9yo can code up when he's passionate and puts his mind to it.


h2. Contributing to recies
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add rspec tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
